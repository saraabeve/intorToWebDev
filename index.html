    <p>The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom is a self-help book by bestselling author Don Miguel Ruiz.<br> The book offers a code of conduct claiming to be based on ancient Toltec wisdom that advocates freedom from self-limiting beliefs that may cause suffering and limitation in a person's life.
    favorite qoute from the book:â€œYou can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action. Without action upon an idea, there will be no manifestation, no results,and no reward"
